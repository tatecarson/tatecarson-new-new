  "body": "Shifting Migration was recorded with a set of binaural in-ear microphones while biking to and from Mills College for a week. I wanted to see if I could make a piece of soundscape music out of the sounds I encounter on my daily commute. I happened upon a fire engine, going I don’t know where, that serves as a dramatic high point of the piece. The original version of this piece consisted of cutup versions of the field recordings, with no other processing being used. Shifting Migration Pt 2 is a continuation of the first version, in which I create many time-stretched versions of the original sound world where one second can last a minute and a minute can last for half a second. This new version is a more imaginary soundscape, where sometimes I’m moving slowly underwater and the next second I’m speeding down a hill.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" title=\"Shifting Migration Pt 2\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/283577116&amp;color=95bcda&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=false\"></iframe>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n---\n\n## Performances\n\n* Electric LaTex, Digital Media Center Theatre, Louisiana State University,\nOctober 2017",
