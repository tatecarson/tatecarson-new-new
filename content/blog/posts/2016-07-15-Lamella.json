  "body": "Lamella can either refer to a thin membrane in bone tissue or the metal tongues that sound in the music box. A contact mic is used to pickup the intricate, machine-like sounds coming from the box, in addition to its melody. My interest is the intersection between these noisy and harmonic sounds. The melody is treated plainly at the beginning and ending of the piece. Granular synthesis is used to decontextualize the melodic sounds into drones and shorter re-pitched sounds. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" title=\"Lamella\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265024743&amp;color=95bcda&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=false\"></iframe>\n\n- - -\n\n## Performances\n\n* Center for New Music, San Francisco, April 14, 2016",
