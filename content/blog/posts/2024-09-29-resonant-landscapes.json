This project enables users to engage with immersive nature soundscapes in an urban environment, fostering a connection between technology and nature appreciation. By mapping the coordinates of state parks onto physical campus locations, Resonant Landscapes creates a scaled geographical rendering of these parks, allowing users to experience rich acoustic environments through their smartphones and headphones. The application utilizes a body-oriented tracking system, which uses built-in smartphone sensors to dynamically change the listener’s orientation. This paper details the technical implementation of the project, including the recording and post-processing of ambisonic audio, the development of the web-based interface, and the integration of GPS and orientation sensors. We discuss how frugal innovation principles guided our design choices, resulting in an accessible and cost-effective solution. The paper also explores the project’s foundations in soundscape studies, locative media, and ecological awareness. Future developments aim to address current limitations, improve the user experience, and extend the application’s functionality.\n\n\n\n### A﻿pp Screenshots\n\n![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2024-09-29-at-10.56.59-am.png)\n\n\n\n### A﻿udio Mostly Presentation\n\n![Presenting at Audio Mostly](/images/uploads/img-4190-audio-mostly-2024.jpg \"Audio Mostly presentation\")\n\n\n\n## Exhibitions\n\n* D﻿akota State University Research Symposium, 2024\n* A﻿udio Mostly Conference, Milan, Italy, September 18 - 20, 2024"
