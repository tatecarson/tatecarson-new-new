  "body": "*Twin highways flung across the evening* uses field recordings in an attempt to avoid music that appears grounded in no particular context and to try to see my work as part of and not separate from society. The title is meant to suggest to the listener that the piece may have something to do with travel, without being overly obvious.\n\nBecause the world is fundamentally chaotic and complex I thought improvisation would be a suitable means to create new imaginary spaces and mimic random encounters that one has on mass transit and walking around a city. To further the feeling of everyday complex city chaos the sound is spatialized in 8 speakers.\n\nTwo sound sources were used, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) and a Chinese new year parade. They were gathered on a single day traveling from Oakland to San Francisco. The BART represents the most inhuman of industrial sounds we might be subjected to on our daily commute, while the Chinese new year parade is an equally loud celebration of a new year with drums and fireworksâ€”sounds of traveling and celebration, the everyday and the ceremonial.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" title=\"Twin highways flung across the evening\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291442233&amp;color=95bcda&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=false\"></iframe>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n- - -\n\n## Performances\n\n* National Student Electronic Music Event, MEIT, University of North\n  Texas, March 10, 2018\n* Electro Acoustic Barn Dance, Terry Concert Hall, Jacksonville University,\n  February 10, 2018\n* Lisser Hall, Mills College, October 28, 2016",
