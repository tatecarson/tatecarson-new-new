  "body": "This piece is based on the environmental sounds of New Orleans. The sounds of cicadas, riverboats, crickets, rain and thunder are familiar and intrinsic to growing up and living in New Orleans. Using these sounds as the basis for the piece is meant to give an impression of being there for a time, happening upon any of these sound objects randomly, as one would by taking a walk around town. It can be thought of as a sort of augmented field recording.\n\n\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" title=\"Before, I wandered as a diversion\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291442346&amp;color=95bcda&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=false\"></iframe>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
