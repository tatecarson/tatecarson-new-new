At the end of the piece you’ll also hear waves recorded in La Jolla, California. I wanted to see if I could make a piece of soundscape music out of the sounds I encounter on my commute. During the extended listening to my environment I started to realize how close the sounds of cars driving to into the distance sounded like waves. I juxtapose these sounds at the end of the piece, as if the end of the journey isn’t Mills but a placid beach. With this juxtaposition I aim to reveal how much noise pollution we endure daily and what our soundscape should be.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" title=\"Shifting Migration\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265026670&amp;color=95bcda&amp;inverse=false&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_user=false\"></iframe> \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
